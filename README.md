# Stock Market Prediction using LSTM and RNN

Welcome to the **Stock Market Prediction** project! This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict stock market prices using advanced deep learning techniques such as **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** and **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**. The goal of this project is to predict future stock prices based on historical data, providing valuable insights to investors and analysts.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, and predicting their future movement is a challenging task. In this project, we use **LSTM** and **RNN** models to analyze time series data from the stock market and forecast future price trends. LSTM and RNN are particularly well-suited for time series prediction tasks due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies in data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **Data Collection**: Collects historical stock prices using APIs like **Yahoo Finance** or **Alpha Vantage**.
- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses data to make it suitable for time series analysis.
- **Modeling**: Implements **LSTM** and **RNN** models for stock price prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Uses various metrics (RMSE, MAE) to evaluate the performance of the model.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs to visualize stock price predictions vs. actual prices.

## üß† Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language for building the entire project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning frameworks for building LSTM and RNN models.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and result plotting.
- **Yahoo Finance API / Alpha Vantage API**: For fetching historical stock data.
- **Scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## üî• Key Highlights

- **LSTM & RNN**: Harnessing the power of deep learning for time series forecasting.
- **Interactive Visualization**: See how the predicted stock prices match up with actual data.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning model parameters for better accuracy.
- **Backtesting**: Evaluate model performance on historical data to simulate real-world stock trading scenarios.
